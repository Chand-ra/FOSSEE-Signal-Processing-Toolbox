   [S,w] = pmusic(x,p)
   [S,w] = pmusic(x,p,w)
   [S,w] = pmusic(x,p,nfft)
   [S,w] = pmusic(x,p,nfft,fs)
   [S,w] = pmusic(x,p,f,fs)
   [S,f] = pmusic(...,'corr')
   [S,f] = pmusic(x,p,nfft,fs,nwin,noverlap)

   [...,v,e] = pmusic(...)
   
   Parameters:
   x - int|double - vector|matrix
   Input signal. In case of a matrix, each row of x represents a
   seperate observation of the signal. If 'corr' flag is specified,
   then x is the correlation matrix.
   If w is not specified in the input, it is determined by the
   algorithm. If x is real valued, then range of w is [0, pi].
   Otherwise, the range of w is [0, 2pi)
   p - int|double - scalar|vector
   p(1) is the dimension of the signal subspace
   p(2), if specified, represents a threshold that is multiplied by
   the smallest estimated eigenvalue of the signal's correlation matrix.
   w - int|double - vector
   w is the vector of normalized frequencies over which the
   pseuspectrogram is to be computed.
   nfft - int - scalar (Default = 256)
   Length of the fft used to compute pseudospectrum. The length of S
   (and hence w/f) depends on the type of values in x and nfft.
   If x is real, length of s is (nfft/2 + 1) {Range of w = [0, pi]} if
   nfft is even and (nfft+1)/2 {Range of w = [0, pi)} otherwise.
   If x is complex, length of s is nfft.
   fs - int|double - scalar (Default = 1)
   Sampling rate. Used to convert the normalized frequencies (w) to
   actual values (f) and vice-versa.
   nwin - int|double - scalar (int only)|vector (Default = 2*p(1))
   If nwin is scalar, it is the length of the rectangular window.
   Otherwise, the vector input is considered as the window coefficients.
   Not used if 'corr' flag present.
   If x is a vector, windowing not done in nwin in scalar. If x is a
   matrix,
   noverlap - int - scalar (Default = nwin-1)
   number of points by which successive windows overlap. noverlap not
   used if x is a matrix
   freqrange - string
   The range of frequencies over which the pseudospetrogram is
   computed. Three possible values - 'onesided', 'twosided', 'centered'
   'corr' flag
   Presence indicates that the primary input x is actually a
   correlation matrix
   
   Examples:
   
   Ex1:
   n = 0:199;
   x = cos(0.257*%pi*n) + sin(0.2*%pi*n) + 0.01*rand(size(n,"r"),"normal");
   [S,w]=pmusic(x,[%inf,1.1],[],8000,2)  ;//where x: [1x200 constant]       p:-infinite signal space and threshold  value is 1.1         window length:-7       Fs:-8000Hz........fftlength:-256
   plot(w,S);.........to see the plot of psuedospectrum estimate of x vs frequencies w
